    <h1>Light Alarm Clock Project - Housing Design</h1>

    <p>The mounting plate for most of the electronics was designed in OpenSCAD. A grid of 8x11 LED's was placed on a MDF
        board, with a cutout for the e-ink display cut into the center. Holes were cut into the MDF that allowed the LED
        mounting wires to be passed through to the LED boards.</p>

    <p>To separate the LED's, 5 mm black foam board was used to create a grid. </p>
