    <h1>Light Alarm Clock Project</h1>

    <p>
        The purpose of this project to to build an alarm clock to replace my 25 year old one (that I've worn out the
        snooze button on).
        This replacement will be designed for better sleep hygiene. I'd like to incorporate the following features:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>The alarm will have an array of RGB LED's that will gradually brighten the room before the alarm goes off.
        </li>
        <li>The time display will be an turned off in the dark to reduce light sources in the bedroom.</li>
        <li>The buttons will be capacitive.</li>
        <li>Most settings and controls will be accessed through a web interface rather than the front panel.</li>
        <li>Support for multiple alarms.</li>
        <li>RTC battery backup.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Some other features I'd like to add:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>I'd like to use an E-ink display, simply because I think they are easy on the eyes.</li>
        <li>The display will have external "Clapper" style illumination for when the time needs to be read in the dark.
        </li>
        <li>As an option, the alarm can be turned off by playing a Simon style game.</li>
        <li>The web interace will allow the user to program in a light show using the RGB LED's</li>
        <li>NTP time setting.</li>
    </ul>
