    <h1>Light Alarm Clock Project - LED Boards</h1>

    <p>Since my original plan was to create a single large board for all the circuit components to mount to, I bought
        100 WS8212 addressable LED's. After pricing out large circuit boards, I decided to split the LED's into multiple
        single boards. In retrospect, it would have been much less work to buy strips or individual boards.
    </p>

    <h2>Testing the LED's</h2>

    <p>To test each individual LED, an Arduino and the WS2812 LED example program from the Adafruit NeoPixel library was used to drive two LED's in series.
        A known working LED was used as the end LED in the chain, and every LED was tested to make sure the colours
        changed properly and the data was passed down the chain.</p>
