    <h1>Light Alarm Clock Project - ESP32 Notes</h1>

    <p>
        To satisfy the project requirements for wifi access and control, I decided to use the ESP32 because it seems to
        be easy to
        program using the Arduino environment, has the capacitive touch sensors I need built in, and is incredibly
        cheap.
    </p>

    <p>
        I bought a DOIT DevKit V1 from Banggood on sale for 6 USD. Unfortunately, it arrived not working. Their was a
        short on the 3.3V
        side of the voltage regulator. Fortunately, the <a href="esp32_schematic.pdf">schematic</a> for this board was
        available, and I was able to find the source of the
        problem and fix it without having to order another one and wait a few weeks to get it from China. In this case,
        the 100 uF electrolytic
        capacitor had failed shorted. Removing it solved the problem. I'll order a replacement in my next Digikey order.
    </p>

    <h2>Initial Tests</h2>
    <p>
        I installed the latest version of the Arduino environment and followed the directions on the <a
            href="https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32">Espressif ESP32 Github
            page</a> to install the Arduino toolchain.
    </p>

    <p>
        To program this board, you have to press and hold the boot button for about a second before the code can flash.
        Uploading the blink LED example works, although
        you have to change the LED pin to pin two on this board (the numbers in the sketch appear to match the GPIO
        numbers on the board/schematic).
    </p>

    <p>
        I also set up the HelloServer example, and was able to connect to the test server.
